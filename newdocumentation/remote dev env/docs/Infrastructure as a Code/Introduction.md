## Infrastructure as Code and Terraform

We embrace the concept of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to manage our infrastructure effectively. Terraform, an industry-leading IaC tool, allows us to define and provision our infrastructure using declarative configurations. With Terraform, we can codify our desired infrastructure state, including the creation and configuration of our GKE cluster, IAM roles and bindings for developers. This approach ensures consistency, reproducibility, and scalability of our infrastructure, reducing the risk of configuration drift and enabling efficient collaboration across teams.
