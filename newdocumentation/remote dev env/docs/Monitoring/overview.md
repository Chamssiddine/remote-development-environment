## Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana

Monitoring and observability are critical aspects of our development environment. 
Prometheus, a powerful monitoring and alerting tool, collects and analyzes metrics from our infrastructure components. 
With Prometheus, we can gain real-time insights into resource utilization, and system health.

Grafana, a feature-rich data visualization and dashboarding tool, integrates with Prometheus to provide rich and customizable dashboards for monitoring our infrastructure. Grafana enables us to create visual representations of metrics, set up alerts, and gain deep insights into the performance and behavior of our development environment.
