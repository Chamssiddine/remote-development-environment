## Single Sign-On with Keycloak

Implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution is essential for ensuring secure and streamlined access to our development environment. Keycloak, a flexible and open-source SSO solution, provides centralized authentication and access control. With Keycloak, we can integrate our infrastructure components, such as Grafana, AWX and more, allowing our team members to authenticate once and seamlessly access multiple services. Keycloak enhances security, simplifies user management, and offers features like role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
