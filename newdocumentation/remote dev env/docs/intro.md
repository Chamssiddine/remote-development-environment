## Project Purpose


I created a remote development environment project to tackle all the challenges posed by the increasing complexity of software and the need to recruit new developers. As I noticed, setting up a development environment manually can be a time-consuming process, particularly for new developers who are not familiar with the system. Therefore, my project aims to leverage cloud-based technologies such as GCP, Ansible, Terraform, AWX, CI/CD, Kubernetes, and SSO with Keycloak to streamline the setup process and allow developers to start creating software efficiently. With my project, developers can access a secure and flexible platform that can be accessed from anywhere, using any device, and eliminate the constraints of hardware or software requirements.
